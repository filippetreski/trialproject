How to run project:
1) Create a database called multi_login
2) Run both database.sql and database_students.sql via phpStorm or any other software you prefer. 
3) Open index.html and follow instructions. 
4) username: admin@admin.com password: admin 
5) You should have the users from database_students.sql listed there.

Notes: I didn't have the time to make pagination and the looks. If you are satisfied with the current work I am more than happy to work on the last remain points.
